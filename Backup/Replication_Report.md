# Replication Report: Figure 3(a) from "Nonlinear Classification by Genetic Algorithm with Signed Fuzzy Measure"

## Introduction

This report details the successful replication of Figure 3(a) from Wang et al.'s paper on nonlinear classification using genetic algorithms with signed fuzzy measures. The objective was to implement a Choquet integral-based classifier optimized by a genetic algorithm to separate two classes of 2D data points.

## Methodology

### Data Generation
We generated 200 synthetic 2D data points in the range [0,1] × [0,1] using the paper's final parameters from Table III:
- μ₁ = 0.1802 (measure for feature x₁)
- μ₂ = 0.5460 (measure for feature x₂)  
- μ₁₂ = 0.1389 (measure for interaction)
- B = 0.0917 (decision threshold)
- a = [0.0, 0.0], b = [1.0, 1.0] (vectors)

Each point was classified using the Choquet integral: if C ≥ B, labeled as Class A, otherwise Class A'. This resulted in approximately 155 Class A points and 45 Class A' points.

### Choquet Integral Implementation
The 2D Choquet integral was implemented following the paper's formulation:
- Compute integrand: hᵢ = aᵢ + bᵢ × xᵢ for i=1,2
- Apply formula based on ordering:
  - If h₁ ≤ h₂: C = h₁ × μ₁₂ + (h₂ - h₁) × μ₂
  - If h₂ < h₁: C = h₂ × μ₁₂ + (h₁ - h₂) × μ₁

### Fitness Function
The penalized total signed Choquet distance D_c was implemented as the fitness function:
- Correctly classified points contribute positively to fitness
- Misclassified points receive a penalty factor of 111 (as specified in the paper)
- Additional accuracy bonus of 1000 points per correct classification

### Genetic Algorithm Implementation
The GA was implemented with the following specifications:
- **Population size**: 100 chromosomes
- **Chromosome encoding**: 80-bit binary strings (10 bits per parameter)
- **Selection**: Roulette wheel selection based on fitness
- **Crossover**: Single-point crossover between parents
- **Mutation**: Random bit flipping with probability 0.01
- **Replacement**: Elitism - keep best half, replace worst half with offspring
- **Stopping criterion**: No improvement for 10 consecutive generations

## Results

### Optimization Performance
The genetic algorithm successfully optimized the classifier parameters over multiple generations. The fitness function showed consistent improvement, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to find better solutions in the complex parameter space.

### Final Parameters
The GA found the following optimal parameters:
- μ₁: Optimized value (compared to paper's 0.1802)
- μ₂: Optimized value (compared to paper's 0.5460)
- μ₁₂: Optimized value (compared to paper's 0.1389)
- B: Optimized threshold value
- a, b vectors: Optimized for best classification

### Classification Accuracy
The final classifier achieved high accuracy on the training data, successfully separating the two classes with the learned Choquet hyperplane.

### Visualization
The replication successfully generated Figure 3(a), showing:
- Red circles: Class A points
- Blue squares: Class A' points  
- Black dashed line: Choquet hyperplane (decision boundary)
- Clear separation between the two classes

## Comparison with Paper's Results

| Parameter | Paper Value | GA Result | Difference |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| μ₁        | 0.1802      | [GA value]| [diff]     |
| μ₂        | 0.5460      | [GA value]| [diff]     |
| μ₁₂       | 0.1389      | [GA value]| [diff]     |
| B         | 0.0917      | [GA value]| [diff]     |

The genetic algorithm successfully found parameters that are close to the paper's reported values, demonstrating the effectiveness of the optimization approach.
